# IO Assistant

Admin management platform and member community portal for the **IO Scholar** community on [Circle.so](https://circle.so). Includes a power-user admin dashboard with bulk operations, content moderation, analytics, and automation -- plus a complete member-facing community UI built on Circle's Headless API.

## Features

### Admin Dashboard (`/dashboard`)

- **Member Management** -- Search, filter, invite, edit, deactivate, ban, and bulk-tag members. View activity scores, spaces, and access groups per member.
- **Space & Content** -- CRUD for spaces, posts, comments, topics, and events. Includes AI-powered post summaries and space group management.
- **Content Moderation** -- Flagged content queue with approve/reject/delete actions, advanced cross-content search, and audience segments.
- **Analytics** -- Community health dashboard with member stats, space distribution, content metrics, top contributors, and gamification leaderboard.
- **Automation** -- Webhook receiver for Circle events, invitation link management, direct messaging, and a JSON-based onboarding rules engine.
- **Settings** -- Manage access groups, profile fields, forms (with submissions), and course sections/lessons from a single interface.

### Member Community (`/community`)

- **Home Feed** -- Personalized post feed from joined spaces with like, comment, and bookmark actions.
- **Spaces** -- Browse all community spaces grouped by category, view posts within each space, create new posts.
- **Post Detail** -- Full post view with rich content, comments thread, like/bookmark.
- **Events** -- Upcoming and past events with RSVP support.
- **Members** -- Search-based member directory with public profiles, gamification stats, and messaging.
- **Notifications** -- Real-time notification feed with unread indicators and mark-all-read.
- **Chat** -- Direct message conversations with real-time message polling.
- **Courses** -- Course catalog with enrollment status.
- **Leaderboard** -- Gamification rankings.
- **Search** -- Global search across posts, comments, and members.
- **Bookmarks** -- Saved posts for later.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router, Turbopack) |
| UI | React 19, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS 4, Lucide icons |
| Data fetching | SWR (client), server-side Circle API proxy routes |
| Auth | iron-session, bcryptjs |
| Circle integration | Admin API v2, Headless Auth API, Headless Member API |
| Utilities | date-fns, Zod, Recharts, Sonner toasts |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm 10+
- A Circle.so community on a **Business** plan or higher (required for Admin API v2 access)
- An Admin API v2 token from your Circle dashboard (**Settings > Developers > Tokens**)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> io-assistant
cd io-assistant
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` and fill in the values:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `CIRCLE_API_TOKEN` | Admin API v2 token from Circle Developers page | Yes |
| `CIRCLE_COMMUNITY_HOST` | Your community hostname, e.g. `io-scholar.circle.so` | Yes |
| `SESSION_PASSWORD` | Random string, at least 32 characters (used to encrypt session cookies) | Yes |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | bcrypt hash of your admin password (see step 3) | Yes |
| `CIRCLE_HEADLESS_AUTH_TOKEN` | Headless Auth token (required for member community UI) | For `/community` |

### 3. Generate your admin password

```bash
npm run hash-password -- yourSecurePassword
```

Copy the output hash and set it as `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in `.env.local`.

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in with the password you chose in step 3.

### 5. (Optional) Enable the member community UI

The member-facing community interface at `/community` requires a **Headless Auth** token from Circle.

1. Go to your Circle dashboard: **Settings > Developers > Tokens**
2. Create a new token with type **Headless Auth**
3. Set `CIRCLE_HEADLESS_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env.local` to this token value

Once configured, community members can sign in at [http://localhost:3000/community/login](http://localhost:3000/community/login) using their Circle member email. The Headless Auth API generates a JWT access token for each member, which is stored server-side in an encrypted session cookie -- no Circle tokens are ever exposed to the browser.

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with Turbopack |
| `npm run build` | Create production build |
| `npm run start` | Run production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run hash-password -- <pw>` | Generate a bcrypt hash for the admin password |

## Architecture

All Circle API calls are made server-side through Next.js API routes. Tokens are never exposed to the browser. The admin dashboard and member community use separate authentication sessions.

```
Browser (Admin)                        Browser (Member)
  │  SWR data fetching                   │  SWR data fetching
  ▼                                      ▼
/api/* routes                          /api/community/* routes
  │  iron-session (admin)                │  iron-session (member JWT)
  │  password-based auth                 │  email-based headless auth
  ▼                                      │  auto token refresh
Circle Admin API v2 client               ▼
  │  Rate limiting, retry              Headless Member API client
  │  In-memory cache                     │  Per-member JWT tokens
  ▼                                      ▼
Circle.so Platform APIs
  ├── Admin API v2         (admin dashboard)
  ├── Headless Auth API    (member login/token management)
  ├── Headless Member API  (member community features)
  └── WebSocket            (future)
```

### Member authentication flow

1. Member visits `/community/login` and enters their Circle member email
2. Server calls Circle Headless Auth API to generate a JWT access token + refresh token
3. Tokens are stored in an encrypted `iron-session` cookie (`io-community-member-session`)
4. On each API request, middleware checks the access token expiry and auto-refreshes via the Headless Auth API if needed
5. On logout, the access token is revoked server-side

## Circle API Rate Limits

The built-in client respects Circle's rate limits:

- **2,000 requests per 5 minutes per IP** (client uses a 1,800 buffer)
- Automatic exponential backoff on `429 Too Many Requests`
- Monthly quotas depend on your Circle plan (Business: 5K, Enterprise: 30K, Plus Platform: 250K)

## Webhook Setup

To receive real-time events from Circle (new members, posts, etc.), configure a webhook in your Circle dashboard pointing to:

```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/circle
```

The endpoint accepts POST requests and logs incoming events. Extend the handler in `src/app/api/webhooks/circle/route.ts` to trigger automation rules.

## Member Community Pages

|-------|-------------|
| `/community/login` | Member sign-in with Circle email |
